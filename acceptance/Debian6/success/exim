 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on
