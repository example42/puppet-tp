Description: network backup service - metapackage
 Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery, and verification
 of computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.

 storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost or
 damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from small
 single computer systems to networks of hundreds of machines.

 scheduling, storage control, node connector, and administrative console.
